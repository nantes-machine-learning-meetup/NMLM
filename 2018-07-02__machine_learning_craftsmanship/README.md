# Machine Learning Craftsmanship

## Résumé

In this meetup, we will introduce the mindset of machine learning
craftsmanship, raising the bar of machine learning development by
practising it and helping others to learn about it. We will focus on
concepts like avoid responding to hype and creating machine learning
solutions to add real value -- not only working on machine learning
scripts but building well-crafted solutions. We'll also talk about
team collaboration and productive partnerships.

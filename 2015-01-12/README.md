# Similarity for Audio : from music to environmental sounds

## Résumé :

Similarity-based tasks are meaningful when considering scientific
problems related to the representation of sound signals. The first
part of the talk will be dedicated to a critical review of the use of
this notion when considering musical signals. This will lead us to
consider environmental sounds. In particular, it might be easier with
this kind of sound to demonstrate the potential benefits of specific
sound representations as well as relating them to knowledge from
neuroscience and psycho-perception.

## Présentateur :

Mathieu Lagrange (IRCAM, Paris & IRCCYN, Nantes) is a CNRS researcher
at IRCCYN. His main interest is the modeling of audio signals. His
expertise covers numerous domains such as computer science, signal
processing and machine learning. He also collaborates with renown
experts in the field of neuroscience psycho perception. After a Phd in
Computer Science at Orange Labs, he carried out several post doctoral
fellowships in Canada (University of Victoria, BC and McGill
University, QC) and in France (Telecom ParisTech).
